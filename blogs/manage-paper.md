# A memo of tips to manage the reading list

## Set a fixed time to walkthrough new papers
* 2 hours per week to add one to three new papers to the reading list

## Read from papers
* Backward: track the citations of a paper
* Forward: track which paper has cited this paper
* Maintain a list of references when reading a paper and check them later

## Set up email alerts
There are multiple sources that you can subscribe from. 
* Google Scholar
* PubMed
* PubCrawler
* Web of Science

## Defining perfect search terms
If you can't define your search terms well, you will receive either too many irrelevant results. Then you need to spend to much time to read through your results. (How to effectively read through search results may be another topic.) Here are some tips to create your search terms.
* Boolean operators (e.g., AND, OR)
* Truncations (a.k.a., wildcards)

## Other ways to define search
* Search by key players in the fields
* Search by citations of the work of key players in the field
* Search by citations of your work
* Search by citations of your PI's work
* Search by citation of key papers

## Update search terms 
* Every few months you should check your search terms
    - Are the terms still relevant to your focus?
    - Should you add new players?
    - Should you add new citations?

## Check out conferences
* Check online before conference
    - The accepted papers
* Attending conferences
    - Ask people in the conference about how they receive the work
    - Listen to the discussion on the presentation
* Check online abstract book for interesting stories and plaers in your field
